<p>On one of those <em>good old days</em>, I wanted to create an identity for myself online. I called myself <em>Ezhik</em> â€“ a hedgehog â€“ and I was building a corner on the internet that was for <em>me</em>. Hence, <em>ezhik.me</em>.</p>
<p>It was a different time. The internet was still young and there was still hope for a brighter future unburdened by all the baggage of history, all the war, all the nations, all the ideologies. The twentieth century was over but the twenty-first did not yet truly begin.</p>
<aside class="right">Young Ezhik was a naive idealist, I know.</aside>
<p>But times have changed. History never ended. And so we are back to the same old mess. <em>Cyberspace</em> never became independent. Worse than that, it was colonized. Little communities, all swept away by waves of corporate interests, propaganda, and psyops.</p>
<p>And so, rather than a cute domain hack, I have to look at <em>.me</em> for what it truly is: the top-level domain (TLD) for the country of Montenegro. And if I'm going to use a country-based TLD, rather than one that just so happened to have a nice ISO 3166 code, I might as well use the TLD for the country that accepted me.</p>
<p>So, <em>ezhik.jp</em> it is.</p> <h2 class="hogs">ðŸ¦” ðŸ¦” ðŸ¦”</h2> <center><sub><time>2025-03-08</time>   </sub></center></article></main></div>

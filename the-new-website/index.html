<p>So here we are. I'm still scouring the internet for my various blog posts (I recovered one so far and it's a silly one!). I've also moved most of my existing stuff on the old site over - ping me if anything's missing as I'm sure it's not gone forever and I want to put it all back.</p>
<p>Also... There's now an <a href="/feed.xml">âœ¨RSS feedâœ¨</a>. Please follow it.</p>
<p>I've also got âœ¨backlinksâœ¨. It's all because of my <a href="https://obsidian.md" class="external">Obsidian</a> addiction. Who needs folders or tags when you have hypertext? Hypertext is all you need. Expect lots of hypertext.</p>
<p>Since it's been a while since I did web stuff and the internet became a very different place during that time, I also now have a <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Please enjoy.</p>
<p>P.S.<br>
What do you think of that hog? I was kinda winging it with this one and don't know if I like this hog or not.</p> <h2 class="hogs">ðŸ¦” ðŸ¦” ðŸ¦”</h2> <center><sub><time>2025-03-03</time>   </sub></center></article></main></div>
